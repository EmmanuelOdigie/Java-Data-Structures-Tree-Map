# Java-Data-Structures-Tree-Map
Tree map, works like 'collection.sort()' but without using collection class, this will automatically organises the elements through the imported class Tree Map, instead of importing two clasees Tree Map & Collections class, you just import one
It works with pairs, ("House", "car") it uses object created '.put' = object.put("House,"Car);
once you have a few set up, it'll then organise the elements
